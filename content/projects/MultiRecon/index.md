The Multi recon project is funded by the French ANR under the code name ANR-20-CE45-0020, with a 498,350.88â‚¬ grant. The project will start on 01/01/2021, and will involve the following partners:
- LaTIM U1101, Brest, France
- CREATIS, Lyon, France
- CEA, Brest, France
- CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France

The objectives of this project are:

- Work package 1: to develop new multimodal convolutional dictionary learning (MCDL) techniques for multimodal image reconstruction;
- Work Package 2: to further extend these methodologies for dynamic imaging: motion compensation and kinetic imaging in PET/CT and PET/MRI;
- Work Package 3: to disseminate the new methodologies via the open source platform CASToR and to evaluate them on realistic data.
