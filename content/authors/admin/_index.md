#I am a medical imaging scientist with a background in mathematics. My work is oriented towards methodologies and algorithm, and their implementation for patient data. In this regard, I am at the interface between theoretical and translational research.

I am an Associate Professor at University of Western Brittany, and part of the LaTIM (INSERM U1101), where I coordinate the Reconstruction research group.

My research work is focused on *tomographic reconstruction* in medical imaging, with an emphasis on PET/CT with motion compensation. I am mostly interested in model-based iterative reconstruction techniques.

My work is oriented towards mathematical methods, and their implementation for the clinic. In this regard, I am at the interface between theoretical and translational research.
