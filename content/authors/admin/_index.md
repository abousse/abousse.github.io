#I am a medical imaging scientist with a background in mathematics. My work is oriented towards methodologies and algorithm, and their implementation for patient data. In this regard, I am at the interface between theoretical and translational research.

I am a full researcher at the [French Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm)](https://www.inserm.fr/en/home/) and part of the [LaTIM, UMR 1101](http://latim.univ-brest.fr). My research is focused on **medical image reconstuction**. I am mostly interested in model-based iterative reconstruction and machine-learning techniques, and their implementation for the clinic. In this regard, I am at the interface between theoretical and translational research.

I obtained my PhD with [LTSI, UMR 1099](http://www.ltsi.univ-rennes1.fr/), [University of Rennes 1](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/) and [Nanjing Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). Following that, I did a postdoc at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), within the [Institute of Nuclear Medicine](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/nuclear-medicine/).
