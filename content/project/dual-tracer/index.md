Personalised medicine is one of the major goals of oncology. With the help of major technological breakthroughs, the fine characterisation of tumors has led to the identification of diagnostic biomarkers, which are prognostic of survival or predictive of the response to therapeutic agents. PET/CT imaging is an integral part of this approach by enabling the distribution and accessibility of biomarkers expressed by tumor or microenvironment in vivo in a non-invasive way. The use of different tracers can provide useful information on intra-tumoral heterogeneities at the voxel level due to different biological processes. However, the registration without loss or modification of quantitative information between two different PET/CT acquisition challenging due to internal and external movement especially when the precision targeted is at the voxel level. It is however possible to consider a single-scan dual-tracer using equal half-life isotope injected with or without adapted delay. Several studies proposed different methods to separate the two PET signals from an unique acquisition. The goal of this project is to develop the methodology for dual-tracer parametric image reconstruction and to reconstruct two separate PET dynamic images from a single dataset that comprises of two mixed tomographic projections.
