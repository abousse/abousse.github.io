The **Reconstruction Group** of the LaTIM deals with the development of novel methodologies for tomographic reconstruction in PET and CT. The objectives of this research are:

- to develop models that can use the maximum amount of data available;
- to derive image reconstruction methodologies for these models.

**Multi-Spectral CT Reconstruction:**

- Direct reconstruction of material decomposition images from raw multi-spectral CT data
- CBCT image quality optimisation of CBCT images for radiotherapy and dosimetry

**PET Reconstruction:**

- New reconstruction algorithms for PET
- Dynamic imaging
- 3-Î³ image reconstruction.

**Deep-Learning:**

- Scatter estimation
- Direct image reconstruction from projection data
- Position estimation in detectors.

Our group also contributes to the **CASToR** project:
